            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This narrative explores the distribution and characteristics of electric vehicles in Washington State based on the latest data.</p>
            <p>Particularly, we are hoping to understand which characteristics, brands, and other attributes of electric vehicles are the most prominent and dominant.</p>
            <p>Some background knowledge tells us that Washington state is a populous, liberal state with lots of legislative and public support/adoption for electric vehicles.</p>
            <p>In exploring the data we can answer some of the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What types of electric vehicles are most common in Washington State?</li>
                <li>What is the range of these vehicles and how does it vary across brands or other characteristics?</li>
                <li>What is the price range of these vehicles and how does brand and characteristics of the vehicles impact the price?</li>
            </ul>
