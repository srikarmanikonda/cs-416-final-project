            <h2>Base MSRP</h2>
            <p>This scene shows a bar chart representing the base MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) of various electric vehicle models. The chart highlights both the affordability and premium segments within the electric vehicle market.</p>
            <p>Understanding the price range of electric vehicles is crucial as it directly impacts consumer adoption. Lower-priced models can make electric vehicles more accessible to a broader audience, while higher-priced models often come with advanced features and longer ranges.</p>
            <p>The chart also includes a dotted line representing the average price of all the vehicles in the dataset. This average price line helps to contextualize where each vehicle stands in terms of cost, providing a quick visual reference for identifying which models are above or below the average price.</p>
            <p>Including this information allows us to analyze the market positioning of different electric vehicle models and understand the economic factors influencing consumer choices.</p>
